This test case is an IKEv2 responder -- it uses a certificate with a wildcard
right= policy that accepts any ID that is properly validated.
It is otherwise identical to lp17, except that now that policy is an ID wildcard.

In this test case, the policy is to permit an initiator from %any to propose
a tunnel to that end point (the /32).

parentI1.pcap is copied from ../lp18-certificateselfI1/OUTPUT/certificateselfI1.pcap
parentI2.pcap is copied from ../lp20-certificateselfI2/OUTPUT/certificateselfI2.pcap

The UNIT1/R2-dump test with packet from parentI2_allzero.pcap proposes a TSi
of 0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0, that is the uninitialized TSi, which is wrong, and
should be rejected.

The UNIT2/R2-any test with packet from parentI2.pcap proposes a TSi which
is example.com (93.184.216.34/32) to a policy of %any.
