	bool "skip DRAM window configuration in MBUS driver"
	depends on MVEBU_MBUS
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to skip DRAM window
	  configuration in MBUS driver.
	  For some Soc, DRAM MBUS window has to
	  be at the beginning, and could not be
	  configured by anyway (keep the default value).

config MVEBU_PHY_INDIRECT
	bool "Access to PHY indirect registers"
	depends on TARGET_ARMADA_8K
	default y
	help
	  Choose this option to add support
	  for PHY indirect access.

config MVEBU_IHB_INIT
	bool "Initialize IHB configuration"
	depends on TARGET_ARMADA_8K
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to add support
	  for IHB phy configuration init
	  enable this option when needed,
	  if device is connected over IHB

config MVEBU_CHIP_SAR
	bool "Chip sample at reset support"
	default y
	help
	  Enable support for chip level sample at reset
	  retreval functions.
	  These functions are used by various U-Boot drivers
	  and subsystem to discover the SoC sample at reset
	  configuration.

config MVEBU_SPL_CHIP_SAR_DUMP
	bool "Sample at reset dump (in SPL)"
	depends on SPL && MVEBU_CHIP_SAR
	default n
	help
	  To add this option you need to add it to the spl config
	  Choose this option to dump sample at
	  reset registers
