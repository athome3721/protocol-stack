UART boot
---------
For Armada-3700 see the section "UART boot for Armada-3700 platform" section.
UART boot is used to load the ATF image using the Xmodem interface when the board boots for
the first time or when the board fails to boot.

1. Set the board to receiving mode using either of the following methods:
	- Start a terminal application (e.g. minicom), and send the Xmodem_boot_pattern.bin file
	  (located under /tools/marvell/xmodem/xmodem_boot.pattern) in ASCII,
	  (for minicom do: Ctrl+A, then S, then select ASCII), and reset the board at the same time.
	- This option is only relevant for Marvell development boards:
	  Set the boot source to UART, using boot source DIP-switch pins, and then reset the board.
2. After booting from UART, or sending the pattern file, characters are displayed on the
   screen every second. These are the Xmodem NACKs that indicate readiness to send the
   new ATF with the Xmodem protocol.
3. Start the TTY ATF transfer using the Xmodem protocol
   (for minicom do: Ctrl/A, then S, and select the Xmodem protocol).
4. Select the ATF image file, and start the transfer.
5. When the transfer is done, U-Boot will start and you should hit <return> to get the U-Boot prompt.
6. When ATF & U-Boot loads refer to doc/mvebu/commands/bubt.txt to burn the ATF image.

UART boot for Armada-3700 platform
---------------------------------
1. The normal ATF build procedure for A3700 target creates an folder
   with all the images required for UART boot under ATF build output
   folder (build/a3700_z/), please make sure u-boot was built before
   ATF, see detail in build.txt.

2. Make sure the target board is in UART mode and ">" prompt is
   presented on the connected terminal. Pressing "Enter" in this mode
   will show "E" and then ">" again.

3. Stop the terminal emulator program on the UART port attached to the
   target board (minicom) for releasing the serial port and allowing
   an application to use it for image download.

4. Start the image download application in the ATF build folder using
   the following parameters (replace UART port number with the one
   connected to the actual target board, in the example /dev/ttyUSB0
   is used).

   Linux downloader usage example:

   sudo WtpDownload_linux.exe -P UART -C 0 -R 115200 \
   -B ./uart-images/TIM_ATF.bin -I ./uart-images/boot-image_h.bin \
   -I ./uart-images/wtmi_h.bin -E

   Windows downloader usage example:

   The target board is connected to COM7 and all images are located in
   the same folder:

   WtpDownload.exe -P UART -C 7 -R 115200 -B TIM_ATF.bin
   -I boot-image_h.bin -I wtmi_h.bin -E

   It is possible to add the "-V" parameter to the command line for
   enabling verbose output.

   Note that "-E" parameter can be dropped from the above commands.
   If you do this, check that the BootROM UART download mode is
   selected in paragraph 2, type in terminal "wtp" without quotes and
   press Enter. Then follow the procedure described in paragraph 3.
   This command will switch the BootROM to WTP download mode. The same is
   archieved by "-E" parameter in latest downloader SW.

5. After the process is finished, start the terminal emulator
   program (minicom) on that the UART port attached to the target
   board and ensure the U-Boot prompt is reached.
