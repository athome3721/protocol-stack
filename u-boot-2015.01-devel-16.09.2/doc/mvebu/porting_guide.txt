Porting Guide
-------------

This document provide instructions for porting the Marvell U-Boot package to a customer board.

Relevant Devices
----------------
	Armada-7040
	Armada-3700

Introduction
------------
	U-Boot configuration is based on three elements:
	- defconfig file:
		This file includes compile-time options for U-Boot, and is used to enable / disable U-Boot device drivers and
		features.
	- include/configs/mvebu-common.h, include/configs/<soc-name>.h (e.g. armada8k.h)
		These files include low-level control over U-Boot definitions, and is likely not to be changed when
		porting to a new board.
	- device-tree files
		These files are located under arch/arm/dts, and include the runtime configuration of U-Boot, and enables passing
		configuration parameters for each of the drivers / units in U-Boot.
		The majority of the porting should be done in the device-tree.
		For more information about device-tree syntax, please refer to the various examples under arch/arm/dts/ or
		visit http://devicetree.org/Device_Tree_Usage
	For the sake of simplicity, all examples below will use the armada-70x0 board, and the new
	board will be called "my_board".

Customer board porting procedure
--------------------------------

	1. defconfig & DT file
	----------------------
	1.1 defconfig
		o Find the defconfig file that matches the SoC flavor being used (e.g. armada-3700, armada-70x0...)
		o Create a new defconfig to hold U-Boot compile time configuration.
			>> cp configs/mvebu_armada70x0_defconfig configs/my_board_defconfig
	1.2 device-tree
		o Create a new DT file to hold U-Boot runtime configuration for your board.
		  Some pre-defined "customer" DT files already exist in U-Boot, it's possible to use them as-is or
		  rename to match your system's name.
		  	>> cp arch/arm/dts/armada-7040-rz1-customer0.dts arch/arm/dts/armada-7040-rz1-my_board.dts

	2. Basic defconfig setup
	------------------------
	2.1. Update my_board defconfig
		>> make my_board_defconfig
		>> make menuconfig
			o Disable CONFIG_DEVEL_BOARD to disable Marvell Development board specific features (reduces size and
			unneeded code).
				-> Marvell Platform Options -> Board Options -> Unselect "Support MVEBU development boards"
			o Update device tree file name:
				-> Device Tree Control -> Default Device Tree for DT control -> "armada-7040-rz1-my_board"
			o Save and exit
		>> make savedefconfnig
		>> cp defconfig configs/my_board_defconfig
	2.2. Select USB2.0 or USB3.0 host controller (Armada-3700 only)
	-----------------------
	Currently there is no concurrent support for both EHCI and XHCI in u-boot, so only one of them can be compiled
	into u-boot image. By default XHCI is enabled, to enable EHCI instead:
		>> make my_board_defconfig
		>> make menuconfig
			o Disable CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD.
				-> Device Drivers -> Support for Host-side USB -> Unselect "xHCI HCD (USB 3.0) support"
			o Enable CONFIG_USB_EHCI_HCD:
				-> Device Drivers -> Support for Host-side USB -> Select "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support"
			o Enable CONFIG_USB_EHCI_MARVELL_BYPASS_BRG_ADDR_DEC:
				-> Device Drivers -> Support for Host-side USB -> EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support
					-> Select "Bypass MARVELL USB 2.0 bridge address decode setting"
			o Enable CONFIG_USB_EHCI_MARVELL_SBUSCFG:
				-> Device Drivers -> Support for Host-side USB -> EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support
					-> Select "MARVELL USB 2.0 sbuscfg setting"
			o Save and exit
	To switch back to XHCI:
		>> make menuconfig
			o Disable CONFIG_USB_EHCI_HCD:
				-> Device Drivers -> Support for Host-side USB -> Unselect "EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support"
			o Enable CONFIG_USB_XHCI_HCD.
				-> Device Drivers -> Support for Host-side USB -> Select "xHCI HCD (USB 3.0) support"
			o Save and exit
	2.3. Compilation sanity
	-----------------------
	Now, compile U-Boot to make sure that everything was set properly.
	(Refer to doc/mvebu/build.txt for detailed build instructions).
		>> export CROSS_COMPILE=<path/to/compiler>
		>> make
	You are ready to start porting U-Boot to match "my_board" configuration.

	3. Device-tree porting
	----------------------
	This is the actual porting of U-Boot to make it work properly on "my_board".
		o Edit the "my_board" dts file under arch/arm/dts/<name of dts given in section 2 above>
		o For each of the (configurable) U-Boot drivers / units, a device tree binding
		  description file exists, which explains the different configuration options
		  for the relevant driver.
	Below is a list of drivers / units, and their relevant DT binding description file:
	(all file paths are relative to "doc/device-tree-bindings/")
