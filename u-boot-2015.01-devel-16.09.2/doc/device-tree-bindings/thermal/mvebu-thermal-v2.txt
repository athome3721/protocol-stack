Marvell Thermal Sensor V2 bindings
=====================================

The thermal node v2 includes a description of the Thermal Sensor External Unit.
The thernal sensor v2 is an on-chip temperature sensor that reads the temperature of
every core and returns the average or the maximum between them.

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,thermal-sensor-v2"
	- reg: the base address of thermal unit
	- gain, offset: parameters of the temperature equation
		which is:
		T(in celsius) = T(read value) * gain + offset
	Note: in the Tsen spec the default value of gain equals 0.425
		In the u-boot we cannot calculate a real number (no floating point).
		For this reason, set the gain and offset by multiplying them by 1000.
		This helps to calculate the equation; see example below.

Example of equation:
T(in celsius) = T(read value) * 0.425 + 153.4
Change to:
T(in celsius) = (T(read value) * 425 + 153400) / 1000

Example:
	thermal: thermal@ {
		compatible = "marvell,thermal-sensor-v2";
		reg = <0x6f8084 0x12>;
		gain = <425>;
		offset = <153400>;
		divisor = <1000>;
		status = "okay";
	};
