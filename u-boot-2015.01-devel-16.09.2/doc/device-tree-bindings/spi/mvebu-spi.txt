Marvell SPI bindings
====================

Driver for SPI bus in Marvell's Armada-8K SoCs

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible
		Should be "marvell,orion-spi".
	- reg
		Base address of SPI-0.
	- clock
		This property points to the used clock for the SPI interface.
		In the following example the node points to the t-clock.
Board specific:
	- spi-max-frequency
		This property is used to calculate the SPI max bus frequency.
		The value is in Bytes.
	- cpol-cpha-cs-bitmap
		This property is bitmap that defines whether the SCK idles high for chip-select i by enabling bit i.
		This one of SPI modes (to idle in high for, for exmaple in Network over SPI)
	- status
		Set if the SPI interface is enabled/disabled.

Example: For SPI-0 node:
	spi0: spi@10600 {
		compatible = "marvell,orion-spi";
		reg = <0x10600 0x50>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <20971520>;
		clock = <&tclk>;
		status = "okay";
		cpol-cpha-cs-bitmap = <1>; /*bit i is set if the cs-i SCK idles high */
	};
