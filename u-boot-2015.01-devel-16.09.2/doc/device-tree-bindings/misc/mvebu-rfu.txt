Marvell RFU address decoding bindings
=====================================

The RFU node includes descriptions of the address decoding unit.
It is used for u-boot 'map' command which displays the RFU window configuration.
Note that the windows configuration is done in ATF package (see ATF porting guide under doc/marvell).

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,mvebu-rfu"
	- reg: the base address of the RFU window
	- max-win: number of the max mbus windows


Example:
	rfu {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-rfu";
		reg = <0x6f0000 0x50>;
	};
