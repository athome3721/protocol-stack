Marvell mpp-bus bindings
========================

The mvebu-mpp-bus driver enables controlling buses
of Multi Purpose Pins(MPP). each dt entry describes a
single MPP bus. an SOC may have several MPP buses.

The mvebu-mpp-bus requires the following proprties:
	- compatible
	  	should be "marvell, mvebu-mpp-bus"
	- bus-name
	  	a unique name identifying the bus. this
		identifier is used to identify the bus
		when calling mpp bus services
	- bank-name
	  	the name of the mpp bank of this bus.
		see mvebu-pinctl driver.
	- pin-count
	  	the amount of pins in this bus.
	- pins
		an integer array of pin ids and functions.
		the first value is the pin id followed by
		the pin function.

Example of a mpp-bus node:
	mpp-bus0 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-mpp-bus";
		bus-name = "spi0";
		bank-name = "armada-380";
		pin-count = <4>;
		pins = <22 1  23 1  24 1  25 1>;
	};
