Marvell SAR bindings
====================

The SAR node include describtion about the sample at reset command, and all the options that the
board support.

The SAR node requires the following properties:
	- compatible = "marvell,sample-at-reset";
	- chip_count: The number of the Sample at reset I2C chips
	- reg: The addresses list of the Sample at reset I2C chips
	- bit_width: The bit width in every I2C chip of the Sample at reset
	- The options of the sample at reset discribed with the child nodes of sar node:
		for example CPU frequency: /sar/cpufreq/
		The option node requires the following proporties:
		- key: The key name of the option, should be the same as subnode name
		- description : The describtion of the option
		- start-bit: Start bit in the I2C chip from the start of the first I2C chip
				for example: 6 means the 1st bit in the 2nd chip (if bit width=5)
		- bit-length: Bit length of the option in the I2C chip
		- option-cnt: The count of the options in this sample at reset node
		- options: Describe the options list by setting the "value", "describtion of the value"
		- default: What is the value of default options
		- swap-bit: Boolean set if the bit is swapped in this option
		- status: Set if the Sample at reset option is enabled/disabled

Example:
sar {
	compatible = "marvell,sample-at-reset";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x4c 0x4d 0x4e>;
	chip_count = <3>;
	bit_width = <5>;

	cpufreq {
		key = "cpufreq";
		description = "CPU frequency";
		start-bit = <0>;
		bit-length = <4>;
		option-cnt = <2>;
		options = "0x0", "1800/900",
			  "0x1", "1600/800";
		default = <0x1>;
		swap-bit;
		status = "okay";
	};
	bootsrc {
		key = "bootsrc";
		description = "Boot source options";
		start-bit = <5>;
		bit-length = <4>;
		option-cnt = <3>;
		options = "0x0", "NAND",
			  "0x1", "SPI",
			  "0x2", "NOR";
		default = <0x1>;
		status = "okay";
	};
};
