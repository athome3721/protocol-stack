Marvell pinctl bindings
=======================

The mvebu-pinctl driver enables changing the function
of multi-purpose pins and controlling GPIOs. each dt
entry describes a single pinctl bank. An SOC may
have several pinctl banks.

Mandatory proprties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible
	  	should be "marvell, mvebu-pinctl".
	- bank-name
	  	Unique name identifying the bank.
	- reg
		Description of the mpp register base and size.
	- pin-count
	  	Amount of pins controlled by this bank.
	- max-func
		Maximum function number supported by this bank.
	- reverse_reg
		A boolean specifying the reigster order is reversed, meaning
		pin x is controlled in register (base - x/8) instead of (base + x/8).
Board specific:
	- pin-func
		Array specifying the function per pin, from left to right.
		mark function as 0xff to keep default pin setting (skip modifying pin value)

Example of a pinctl bank node:
	pinctl@18000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-pinctl";
		bank-name ="armada-380";
		reg = <0x18000 0x24>;
		pin-count = <64>;
		max-func = <7>;
			  /* 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 */
		pin-func = < 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
			     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 6
			     6 2 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2
			     2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2
			     2 2 0 2 4 0 0 4 5 5
			     5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5
			     0 0 0 0>;
	};
