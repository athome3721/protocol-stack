Marvell FLC bindings
=====================================

Final Level Cache for the McKinley (MCK) Memory Controller is a unit that is embedded inside the
memory controller. When the unit is enabled, it effectively turns the memory controller into a cache
unit using DDR memory to cache data for it. An external memory device would be required to serve
as main memory.

The FLC node include description about the FLC memory mapping configuration.

The FLC node requires the following properties:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,mvebu-flc"
	- reg: the base address of the FLC unit
	- flc_ext_dev_map: entry that include the configuration of the FLC External Memory Device Map.
	- flc_nc_map: (optional) entry that include the configuration of the FLC Non-Cacheable Memory Map.
		The unit enables to define part of the DDR memory as Non-Cacheable memory, used as a regular
		DDR memory.
	  every mapping entry should have 4 parameters:
	  - high base address of the window
	  - low base address of the window
	  - high size of the memory
	  - low size of the memory
	  The size must be a power of 2 between 8 MB to 1 TB

Note: if the base address and size is more than 32bit, it divided into high and low,
	Base example:
		base address: 0x10f0000000 should divided into:
		base address high: 0x10
		base address low: 0xf0000000

Example:
Define FLC external memory of 8 GB, base address of the external memory 0x100000000
Define FLC Non-Cacheable Memory - the first 8 MB of the DDR used as a regular DDR.
flc {
	compatible = "marvell,mvebu-flc";
	reg = <0x20700 0x100>;
	flc_ext_dev_map = <0x1 0x0 0x2 0x0>;
	flc_nc_map = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x800000>
}
