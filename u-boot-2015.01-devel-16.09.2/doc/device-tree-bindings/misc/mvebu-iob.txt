Marvell IOB address decoding bindings
=====================================

The IOB node includes descriptions of the address decoding unit.
It is used for u-boot 'map' command which displays the IOB window configuration.
Note that the windows configuration is done in ATF package (see ATF porting guide under doc/marvell).

IOB supports up to n (in CP110 n=24) windows for external memory transaction.
When a transaction passes through the IOB, its address is compared to each of
the enabled windows. If there is a hit and it passes the security checks it is
advanced to the target port.

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible
		should be "marvell,mvebu-iob"
	- reg: the base address of the IOB unit
	- max-win: number of the max IOB windows


Example:
	map-iob {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-iob";
		reg = <0x190000 0x50>;
		max-win = <24>;
	};
