Marvell I2C bindings
====================

The I2C driver provides read / write access to external peripherals
using the I2C bus.

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible
		Should be "marvell,mvebu-i2c".
	- reg
		Base address and size of I2C-0.
	- clock
		This property points to the clock used for the I2C interface.
		In this example the node points to the t-clock.
	- status
		Set to okay/disabled if the I2C interface is enabled/disabled.

Example for I2C-0 node:
	i2c0: i2c@11000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-i2c";
		reg = <0x11000 0x4>;
		clock = <&tclk>;
		status = "okay";
	};
