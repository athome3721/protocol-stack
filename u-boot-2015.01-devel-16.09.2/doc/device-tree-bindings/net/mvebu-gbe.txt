Marvell Armada3700 GBE bindings
====================

This GBE driver supports Marvell Armada3700 SoC, which implements the GBE core operations.
The node name is neta0 to show that it's GBE-0, for GBE-1 it should be neta1.

The GBE node for Armada3700 requires the following properties:
SoC specific:
	- compatible: Should be "marvell,armada-3700-neta".
	- reg: The base address of the GBE unit.
Board specific:
	- phy_mode: The phy mode for the GBE interface, which should be one of the following:
		"mii",
		"gmii",
		"sgmii",
		"sgmii_2500",
		"qsgmii",
		"tbi",
		"rmii",
		"rgmii",
		"rgmii_id",
		"rgmii_rxid",
		"rgmii_txid",
		"rtbi",
		"xgmii",

Optional properties:
	- phy_addr: The phy address for the GBE interface when connected to
	  external PHY device.
	- fixed-link: The GBE interface works at the fixed-link mode,
	  in this case, "phy_addr" is uesless.
	  - speed: link speed in Mbits/sec, accepted values are: 10, 100 and 1000
	  - full-duplex: duplex configuration:
	    "full-duplex" for full duplex, otherwise, works in half duplex.

Examples:
	neta0: neta@30000 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-neta";
		reg = <0x30000 0x20>;
		phy_addr = <0x0>;
		phy_mode = "rgmii";
		status = "disabled";
	};

	neta1: neta@40000 {
		status = "okay";
		phy_mode = "sgmii";
		fixed-link {
			speed = <1000>;
			full-duplex;
		};
	};
