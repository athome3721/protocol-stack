PXA3xx NAND DT bindings
=======================

Implementation of the NAND controller device driver for Marvell SoCs

Mandatory properties:
SoC specific:
- compatible:          Should be set to: marvell,mvebu-pxa3xx-nand
- reg:                 The register base for the controller
- #address-cells:      Set to <1> if the node includes partitions

Optional properties:
SoC specific:
	- nand-enable-arbiter: Set to enable the bus arbiter
	- nand-keep-config:    Set to keep the NAND controller config as set by the bootrom.
Board specific:
	- nand-ecc-strength:   Number of bits to correct per ECC step
	- nand-ecc-step-size:  Number of data bytes covered by a single ECC step
	- num-cs:              Number of chipselect lines to use

The following ECC strength and step sizes are currently supported:
- nand-ecc-strength = <1>, nand-ecc-step-size = <512>
- nand-ecc-strength = <4>, nand-ecc-step-size = <512>
- nand-ecc-strength = <8>, nand-ecc-step-size = <512>

Example:
	nand@720000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mvebu-pxa3xx-nand";
		reg = <0x720000 0x100>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		nand-enable-arbiter;
		num-cs = <1>;

		/* partitions (optional) */
		nand-ecc-strength = <4>;
		nand-ecc-step-size = <512>;
	};
