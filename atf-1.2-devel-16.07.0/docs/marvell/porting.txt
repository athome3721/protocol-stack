ATF Porting:
------------

This document describes how to port ATF to a customer board, assuming that the SoC being used is already supported
in ATF.


Source code structure
---------------------

- The cusomer platform specific code will reside under plat/marvell/<soc family>/<soc>_cust.
  e.g. plat/marvell/a8k/a7040_cust
- The platform name for build purposes is called <soc>_cust (e.g. a7040_cust).
- The build system will reuse all files from within the soc directory, and take only the porting
  files from the customer platform directory.


Porting:
--------
All files that require porting are located under the plat/marvell/<soc family>/<soc>_cust directory.

Common to all SoC's
  o DDR Porting (dram_porting.c):
	- This file defines the dram topology on the customer's board.
	- <TODO> Need to add detailed description of the porting fields.

A7K/A8K specific
  o SoC Physical Address Map (soc_phys_map_config.c):
	- This file describes the SoC physical memory mapping to be used for the CCU, RFU, AXI-MBUS and IOB
	  address decode units (Refer to the functional spec for more details).
	- In most cases, using the default address decode windows should work OK.
	- In cases where a special physical address map is needed (e.g. Special size for PCIe MEM windows,
	  large memory mapped SPI flash...), then porting of the SoC memory map is required.
	  Note: For a detailed information on how CCU, RFU, AXI-MBUS & IOB work, please refer to the SoC functional spec,
	  and under doc/marvell/misc/mvebu-[ccu/iob/amb/rfu].txt files.
